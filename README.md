This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) landing page bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), based off a [Figma Banking UI](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1282341166777547361)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, cd into `banking-app` (super original name I know) and run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load custom Google fonts.
